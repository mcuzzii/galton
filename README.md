# Manim Galton Board Simulator
The code in this repository (Collision.py) is run with Manim, which will take approximately one hour and ten minutes to render a 30 second simulation
of a Galton Board with 1000 balls.

Randomization is incorporated so running the same code twice will yield different random initial conditions and so different results.

Thanks for checking it out!
